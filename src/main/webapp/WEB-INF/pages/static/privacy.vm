        <h2 class="title">Privacy policy</h2>

        <p class="mb">Transn, Inc. (“Transn,” “we,” or “us”) knows that you care how information about you is used and shared. This Privacy Policy explains what information of yours will be collected by Transn when you use our website and/or related Transn software and services (the “Service”), how the information will be used, and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of information. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h3 class="title-hei">Information We Collect</h3>
        <p class="mb">User-Provided Information: As part of using the Service, you may be required to provide certain information in order to register and set up an account (“Registration Data”). If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our responses. If you invite a friend to try Transn, we will use that friend’s email address for the sole purpose of sending your invitation.</p>
        <p class="mb">Cookie Information: When you visit Transn.com, we may send one or more cookies – a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. A cookie does not collect personal information about you. Transn uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>
        <p class="mb">Log File Information: Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you view Transn.com or our related websites, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</p>
        <p class="mb">Clear Gifs Information: When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. No personally identifiable information from your Transn account is collected using these clear gifs. We may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make Transn better for our users.</p>

        <h3 class="title-hei">How We Use Your Information</h3>
        <p class="mb">User-Provided Information: By providing Transn your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. As part of our registration process we will also ask your permission to use your email address to send you other messages, such as newsletters, changes to features of the Service, or special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may change your marketing preferences by going to your account setttings page.</p>
        <p class="mb">Transn may use certain information about you without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and improve the Service.</p>
        <p class="mb">We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and traffic; and (e) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP.</p>

        <h3 class="title-hei">How We Share Your Information </h3>
        <p class="mb">Personally Identifiable Information: Transn will not rent or sell your personally identifiable information to others and will not share it with others except as provided herein. Transn may share your personally identifiable information with third parties solely for the purpose of providing services to you. If we do this, such third parties’ use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy. We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of Transn (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).</p>
        <p class="mb">As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.</p>
        <p class="mb">Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, Transn will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our rights, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Transn, our users or others.</p>
        <p class="mb">Non-Personally Identifiable Information: We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them and us understand usage of the Service.</p>

        <h3 class="title-hei">How We Protect Your Information</h3>
        <p class="mb">Transn makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Transn and you do so at your own risk.</p>

        <h3 class="title-hei">Compromise of Personal Information</h3>
        <p class="mb">In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Transn will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p>

        <h3 class="title-hei">Your Choices About Your Information </h3>
        <p class="mb">You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information to Transn, in which case Transn will not be able to provide the Service to you. You can review and correct the information about you that Transn keeps on file by contacting us directly at support@Transn.com.</p>

        <h3 class="title-hei">Children’s Privacy</h3>
        <p class="mb">Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Transn does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on Transn. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact our customer service.</p>

        <h3 class="title-hei">Notification Procedures</h3>
        <p class="mb">It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice or through conspicuous posting of such notice on our Website page, as determined by Transn in its sole discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h3 class="title-hei">U.S. Based Service</h3>
        <p class="mb">Our center of operation is in the United States. Your data is held in the United States and transactions are processed in US Dollars on servers in the United States. As such, all data is held in accordance with United States laws and procedures which differ from those in other regions of the world, such as the European Union. By using this service, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to these data policies.</p>

        <h3 class="title-hei">Changes to Our Privacy Policy </h3>
        <p class="mb">If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on our website. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
